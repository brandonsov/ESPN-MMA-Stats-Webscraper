# ESPN-MMA-Stats-Webscraper

I could not find an API available to query ESPN MMA stats on UFC Fighters so I am creating this webscraping bot to source this data using [ESPN MMA FightCenter](https://www.espn.com/mma/fightcenter) as a primary source.

Some other sources I could utilize:
- [fightmatrix](https://fightmatrix.com/)
- [tapology](https://www.tapology.com/)
- [sherdog](sherdog.com)
